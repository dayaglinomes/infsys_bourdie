ckm: Three 246 by 246 matrices.

BACKGROUND This data set was prepared by Ron Burt. He dug out the 1966 data collected by Coleman, Katz and Menzel on medical innovation.
They had collected data from physicians in four towns in Illinois, Peoria, Bloomington, Quincy and Galesburg.

They were concerned with the impact of network ties on the physicians' adoprion of a new drug, tetracycline.
Three sociometric matrices were generated. One was based on the replies to a question,
"When you need information or advice about questions of therapy where do you usually turn?"
A second stemmed from the question "And who are the three or four physicians with whom you most often find yourself discussing cases or therapy in the course of an ordinary week â€“ last week for instance?" 
And the third was simply "Would you tell me the first names of your three friends whom you see most often socially?"


But you are only presented with first network on advice.
In addition, records of prescriptions were reviewed and a great many other questions were asked. 
In the vertex attributes I have included 13 items:
* city of practice, 
* recorded date of tetracycline adoption date
*  years in practice
*  meetings attended
*  journal subscriptions
*  free time activities
*  discussions
*  club memberships
*  friends
*  time in the community
*  patient load
*  physical proximity to other physicians and medical specialty.
